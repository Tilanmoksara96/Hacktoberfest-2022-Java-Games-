## How to Participate in Hacktoberfest 2022? :octocat: 
### Participating as a Contributor
As a contributor, during October you must have four PRs that either:

    Are merged into a participating repository;
    Or have the hacktoberfest-accepted label;
    Or have an approving review, but not closed or draft.

A participating repository is a repository that has the hacktoberfest topic. Participation can be done through GitHub or GitLab.

### Participating as a Maintainer
To participate as a maintainer, you must facilitate participation for contributors. The first step is to either:

   1. Add the hacktoberfest topic to your repository;
   2. Or add the hacktoberfest-accepted label into your repository to be used on pull requests.

Then, you must merge four PRs into your repository during October. If you decide to use the second option mentioned in the first step, make sure to add the hacktoberfest-accepted label into these PRs.

## Rules

    1. For PRs to be counted into your participation in Hacktoberfest, they must be merged between October 1st and October 31st.
    2. Contributions must be made to public repositories.
    3. If a PR has a label that contains the word spam in it, the PR will not be counted. Also, if a participant has 2 or more spam PRs, they'll be disqualified from Hacktoberfest.
    4. If a PR has a label that contains the word invalid, it will not be counted. The exception for this is if the PR also has the label hacktoberfest-accepted.
